It just looks like google, doesn't function like it.

Things that look good and work:
	1.) The foooter looks pretty close.
	2.) All the links work.
	3.) Everything looks pretty well positioned


Elements of the page that need work:
	1.) The google apps drop down menu (located in the header) needs some work
	2.) The size, shape and texture of the search bar and buttons need to be adjusted.
	3.) The "I'm Feeling Lucky Button" and how rotates between different phrases needs to be worked on
	4.) The Google image above the search bar and how the images changes almost everyday needs to be added (or something similar).
	5.) The footer also may need to be positioned better (right side of footer)
